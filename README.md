### Rules
There's a few rules you should follow.  

- file name: [your nickname]_[problem name].[extension]  
```  
    e.g. MissingInteger/JeongMinCha_MissingInteger.py
```  
- If you use java-like languages, you should make your code file name
be equal to your class name. Thus, in case you cannot follow the above
rule, just make your directory and put the files into the directory.  
```  
    e.g. BinaryGap/JeongMinCha_java/BinaryGap.java
```
